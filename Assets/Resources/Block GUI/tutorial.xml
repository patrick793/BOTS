	<page id="2"><rect x="2" y="136" w="274" h="630"/>Along the left side of the screen, you'll see all the building blocks you can use to make a level. You're allowed to use up to 20 building blocks to make your level. The icon for each block shows what the robot will build.</page>
	<page id="3"><rect x="2" y="136" w="274" h="630"/>The level can only be 10 squares long and 8 squares high. Also, you can't put anything that would block off your own path.</page>
